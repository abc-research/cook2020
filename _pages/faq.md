**What is the sampling rate of each device?**

The sampling rate for the accelerometers is a little bit variable as we used Android to collect the samples. Android operates sensors on a “best effort” policy, meaning that even if we set a desired sampling rate, the actual sampling rate will vary during the application time depending on other factors such as battery level or free memory.

That said,  the average sampling rate for the smartwatches (on each wrist) was about 100Hz and for the smartphones (hip and arm) was about 50Hz. That is why you might get different number of samples on the segments but they all represent 1 minute.

The sampling rate of motion capture is 100Hz.
