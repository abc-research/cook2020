  image_description: "Cooking Activity Recognition Challenge"
---
<p>For many seniors, the ability to cook is a strong indicator of cognitive health, eating habits and the ability to live independently. Cooking, one of the instrumental activities of daily living, involves several steps and a plan to follow such steps. To monitor or assist an elder during cooking, we need to be able to detect the actions involved in each step like cutting, reaching, mixing, or heating.</p>
<p>
In this challenge, participants will design methods to recognize cooking steps from inertial data.  The data was collected during cooking sessions of different foods. It involves several steps performed with a different sequence.  We will hold a workshop to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches, open challenges and future perspectives of the topic,
