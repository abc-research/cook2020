  image_description: "Cooking Activity Recognition Challenge"
---
<p>Activity Recognition is the process of automatically inferring what a user is doing based on sensor observations. When your smartphone automatically identifies if you have been walking or running, it is doing activity recognition using the observations of its accelerometer sensor.
In this challenge, participants will design methods to recognize cooking steps from inertial data.  The data was collected during cooking sessions of different foods.
It involves several steps performed with a different sequence.

We will hold a workshop at ABC Conference to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches, open challenges and future perspectives of this topic.
